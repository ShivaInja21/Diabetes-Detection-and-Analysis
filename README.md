# Diabetes Detection and Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores machine learning techniques to detect diabetes using a structured health dataset. The project includes data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection of diabetes allows for timely intervention and improved health outcomes.

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for analyzing diabetes data and building predictive machine learning models to classify whether a person has diabetes based on clinical features such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset used in this project typically resembles the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD)** — a well‑known dataset used for diabetes prediction tasks. It typically has features such as:

- **Pregnancies** — Number of times pregnant  
- **Glucose** — Plasma glucose concentration  
- **BloodPressure** — Diastolic blood pressure  
- **SkinThickness** — Triceps skin fold thickness  
- **Insulin** — 2‑hour serum insulin  
- **BMI** — Body Mass Index  
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction** — A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history  
- **Age** — Age of the subject  
- **Outcome** — 0 (Non‑diabetic) or 1 (Diabetic)
